          I'm Richard and I'm a web developer who loves finding the solution to the "how".
          I dove into web development because I wanted to challenge myself and I love solving puzzles.
          I see coding as building a solution to a puzzle, and it's the fun in figuring out how to arrive to it.
          I grew up being immersed in how technology evolved from something like blocky cellphones to smartphones
          or 32-bit video games to virtual reality gaming. However, instead of simply being just fascinated by it, I'm striving
          to be apart of it.

          I also love playing games in all forms whether it be tabletop or video. View my latest projects below and more on my
